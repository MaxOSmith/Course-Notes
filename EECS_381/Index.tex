\abstr{This elective course introduces advanced concepts and techniques in practical C/C++ programming. We will start with a
quick, but deep, introduction to important topics in C programming, and then the course will emphasize object-oriented programming
with the use of single and multiple inheritance and polymorphism, and using the Standard Library algorithms and containers. Key
ideas in object-oriented analysis and design and common design patterns will be introduced. Programming projects will focus on
learning and using techniques that are valuable for professional practice in developing and extending large scale or high-performance
software relatively easily. In addition to these content goals, an important function of the course is to help students develop good
programming practices, style, and skill, with as much personalized coaching and critique of individual studentâ€™s code as possible. In
short, the course is intended for those who want to start becoming outstanding programmers.}
