	\item \textbf{Linear Regression:} $y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})=w_0+w_1 x_1+\ldots +w_D x_D$
	\item Limited on linear function of input variables $x_i$
	\item Extend the model with nonlinear functions, where $\phi_j (x)$ are known as basis functions:
		$$y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})=w_0 +\sum_{j=1}^{M-1}w_j\phi_j (x)$$
	\item $w_0$ allows for any fixed offset in data, and is known as the \textbf{bias parameter}.
	\item Given a dummy variable $\phi_0 (x)=1$, our model becomes:
		$$y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})=\sum_{j=0}^{M-1}w_j\phi_j (x)=\mathbf{W}^\mathbf{T} \mathbf{\phi} (x)$$
	\item Functions of this form are called \textbf{linear models} because the function is linear in weight.
