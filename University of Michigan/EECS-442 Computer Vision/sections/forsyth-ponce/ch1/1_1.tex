\begin{itemize}[--]
	\item \textbf{Subtended:} form (an angle) at a particular point when straight lines from its extremities are joined at that point.
	\item \textbf{Solid Angle:} is the two-dimensional angle in three-dimenal space that an object subtends at a point.
	\item \textbf{Radiance:} the amount of energy travelling at some point in a specified direction, per unit time, per unit area perpendicular to the direction of travel, per unit solid angle (units of Watts per square meter per steradian $Wm^{-2}sr^{-1}$).
	\begin{itemize}[--]
		\item Small patch viewing a source frontally collects more energy than the same patch viewing a source radiance along a nearly tangent direction.
		\item Radiance is a function of position and direction (source position and direction of beam).
		\item Denoted: $L(x, direction)$, where direction can be specified: $(\theta, \phi)$ or $x_1\to x_2$
