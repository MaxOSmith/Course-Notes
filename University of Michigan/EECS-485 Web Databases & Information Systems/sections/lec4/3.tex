\subsection{Mark up Language}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add tags as ``mark up'' to text
	\item Document still ``primarily'' text
	\item Mark up improves both structure and presentation
	\subsubsection{Hypertext}
	\item Text with embedded links to other documents
	\item Anchor tag <a href = ``link''>atext</a>
	\subsubsection{Escape Strings}
	\item Some characters have special meaning in an application context
	\begin{itemize}
		\item / or ? in URL
	\end{itemize}
	\item Need an \textbf{escape string}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item e.g., \&lt; \&euro; \&amp;
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{XML}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No standard set of stags
	\item Define tags and use them
	\item Need to balanced like parentheses
	\item Tags form a heirarchy of objects
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Document Object Model (DOM) tree
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{XHTML}
\begin{itemize}
	\item HTML permits unbalanced tags
	\item HTML cannot be derived from XML
	\item XHTML is a dialect of HTML that meets XML rules (proper containment)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTML5}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Merges all that has happened over years related to HTML
	\begin{itemize}
		\item XHTML
		\item Browser-specific estensions of HTML
		\item OTher use cases of broad interest
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layout - CSS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modern HTML seperates content form the way content looks (through CSS)
	\item Included via:
	%<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"\>
	\subsubsection{Scaling and Positioning}
	\item Biggest problem in layout
	\item If display screen width changes, do you:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Keep your page fixed width any way
		\item Adjust page width, and use more lines of text - increasing page length
		\item Adjust path width and font size so everything scales evenly
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Content}
\begin{itemize}
	\item So far, HTTP servers are fileservers
	\begin{itemize}
		\item And browsers are HTML renderers
	\end{itemize}
	\item Think of the things that are impossible with simple static pages
	\item In the old days, almost all requests were just disk loads
\end{itemize}

\subsection{N-tier model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We've seperated persistent storage from user interactions
	\item Web apps often break down pieces of code functionality into machines
	\img{.8}{sections/lec4/model.png}
	\subsubsection{Model-View-Controller}
	\item System to sort out who does what
	\img{.8}{sections/lec4/mvc.png}
	\item HTML is the model
	\item CSS is the view
	\item Browser is the controller
	\item Model exists in the database/filesystem
	\item View is the computed HTML++
	\item Controller is processing of user input
	\img{.8}{sections/lec4/mvc.png}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Object-Relational Mapping}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Addresses the ``impedance mismatch'' between relational and object worlds
	\item Map object classes to database tables
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Client}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lots of different options for client-side content, but most people nowadays conerging on AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item JavaScript for running in the browser
		\item XML for data exchange with server, via HTTP
		\item After intiial page load, similar to client/server program, not traditional web page loads
	\end{itemize}
	\item JS code runs when triggered by %<script>
	\item Has read/write access to the page's DOM
	\item e.g.,
	\img{.8}{sections/lec4/jsdom.png}
	\item Client-side code will display code instead of end result. Server-side code would only show result.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Browser Security}
\begin{itemize}
	\item JS is potential security nightmare, so in-browser programs are sandboxed
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Same-origin policy}: scripts from the same origin can access each others' data + methods
		\item scripts form different origins cannot see each other
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Attacks}
	\item Cross-site scripting
	\item SQL Injection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Browser Internals}
\img{.8}{sections/lec4/INT.PNG}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chome added more break-down of functionality allowign you to kill tabs-by-process
\end{itemize}
